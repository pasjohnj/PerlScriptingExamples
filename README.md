# Perl Scripting Examples for the Text Creation Partnership (TCP)
## 1_file_discrep.pl
This script reconciles what files are on hand with what markup reviewers indicated they completed.
1.) It creates two lists, one list of files on hand, and one list of files reviewers claimed completed, and compares them.
2.) It outputs a 3rd list of file discrepancies--either files on hand but unclaimed, or claimed but on hand--that the operator then has to resolve. (ie, figure out where they are)
3.) The operator runs this script until there are no more discrepancies.
This script was run monthly as part of a suite of reporting routines.
